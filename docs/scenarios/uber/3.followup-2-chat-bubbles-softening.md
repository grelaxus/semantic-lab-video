Lets make the chat bubbles more sophisticated: two distinct physical forces interacting simultaneously: **Vertical Stack Momentum** (the feed jumping) and **Jelly/Elastic Physics** (the individual bubble deformation).

To replicate this "organic" feel in Remotion, we cannot treat the chat bubbles as solid bricks. We must treat them as **soft bodies** (like gelatin) that react to force.

Here is the deep technical breakdown of those specific mechanics:

### 1. The Container Physics: "The Reverse Gravity Bounce"
**The Observation:** The entire conversation doesn't just slide up; it behaves like a spring loaded platform. When a new element is inserted at the bottom, the whole stack is "kicked" upward, overshoots its target, and settles back down.

**The Physics (The "Shockwave"):**
Instead of animating the `top` or `margin` of the new message, you must animate the `translateY` of the **entire container div** holding the messages.

*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  **State A:** Container is at Y=0.
    2.  **Trigger:** New message arrives (height ~60px).
    3.  **The Kick:** The container instantly shifts to simulate the new space, but we animate the *correction*.
    4.  **The Spring:**
        *   **Overshoot:** The container moves UP by 70px (overshooting the 60px height).
        *   **Rebound:** It falls back down to 55px.
        *   **Settle:** It rests at 60px.

**Remotion Implementation:**
Use a spring with **low damping** and **high mass**.
```javascript
const scrollSpring = spring({
  frame: frame - delay,
  from: 0,
  to: -messageHeight, // Negative because we are moving UP
  config: {
    stiffness: 150, // High energy
    damping: 12,    // Low friction (allows for 2-3 bounces)
    mass: 1.2       // Heavy feel (slower oscillation)
  }
});
// Apply <div style={{ transform: `translateY(${scrollSpring}px)` }}>
```

### 2. The "Diving Board" Effect (The Wiggle)
**The Observation:** "The very first chat bubble even wiggles on the right end up and down, whilst the left one stays in place."

**The Mechanics:**
This is purely a result of **Rotational inertia** combined with **Transform Origins**.
*   **The Anchor:** The received message (grey) has a "tail" on the bottom-left. This is its anchor point.
*   **The Force:** When the bubble scales up, energy travels from the anchor (left) to the tip (right).
*   **The Wiggle:** Because the right side is "free," it carries momentum. If the bubble scales up quickly, the right side will visually "flap" or rotate slightly before stabilizing.

**Remotion Implementation:**
You need to apply a slight **Rotation Spring** in addition to the Scale Spring.

*   **Pivot Point:** `transformOrigin: "bottom left"`
*   **Scale:** `0 -> 1`
*   **Rotation:** Start at `-5deg` (tilted down) -> Overshoot to `3deg` (tilted up) -> Settle at `0deg`.

```javascript
const wobble = spring({
  frame,
  from: -5, // Start slightly tilted down
  to: 0,
  config: { stiffness: 200, damping: 5 } // Very bouncy
});

// Style: transform: `scale(${scale}) rotate(${wobble}deg)`
```

### 3. Squash and Stretch (The Width Bounce)
**The Observation:** "Wiggling/bouncing both sideways (width) and vertically."

**The Mechanics:**
In traditional animation, to preserve volume, if an object gets taller, it should get thinner. If it gets wider, it should get shorter.
To replicate the "jelly" hit:
1.  **Impact:** When the bubble appears, it should start **Wide and Short** (Squashed).
2.  **Rebound:** It snaps to **Tall and Thin** (Stretched).
3.  **Settle:** It returns to normal.

**Remotion Implementation:**
You need **two separate springs** for X and Y with slightly offset stiffness. This desynchronization creates the "jelly" wobble.

*   **Scale X Spring:** Fast and stiff (reacts instantly).
*   **Scale Y Spring:** Slightly lazier (reacts with delay).

```javascript
const scaleX = spring({
  frame,
  config: { stiffness: 250, damping: 10 }
});

const scaleY = spring({
  frame,
  config: { stiffness: 180, damping: 12 } // Different physics than X!
});

// Result: The bubble distorts as it grows because X and Y reach 1.0 at different times.
// Style: transform: `scale(${scaleX}, ${scaleY})`
```

### Summary of the "Production-Ready" Prompt Additions:

When generating the code, specifically ask for:
> "Implement a 'JellyPhysics' component for the chat bubbles.
> 1. Use `transform-origin` set to the bubble tail (bottom-left for receiver, bottom-right for sender).
> 2. Desynchronize `scaleX` and `scaleY` springs to create a squash-and-stretch deformation effect on entry.
> 3. Animate the *container* of the messages with a high-mass, low-damping spring to simulate the entire feed bouncing vertically when a new item is added (the reverse gravity stack effect)."
